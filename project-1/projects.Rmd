##***Project 1: Data Wrangling***

In this project, you’re given a text file with chess tournament results where the information has some structure. Your
job is to create an R Markdown file that generates a .CSV file (that could for example be imported into a SQL database)
with the following information for all of the players:

Player’s Name, Player’s State, Total Number of Points, Player’s Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents
For the first player, the information would be:

Gary Hua, ON, 6.0, 1794, 1605

1605 was calculated by using the pre-tournament opponents’ ratings of 1436, 1563, 1600, 1610, 1649, 1663, 1716, and
dividing by the total number of games played.

The chess rating system (invented by a Minnesota statistician named Arpad Elo) has been used in many other contexts,
including assessing relative strength of employment candidates by human resource departments.

###***Data Loading*** { .tabset .tabset-fade }

####Getting the data


File loaded from local directory or online repository.
```{r}

tournament_data <- readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sirwel/Data607/master/project-1/tournamentinfo.txt",warn = FALSE)

```

####Data Capture File


Source used for data extraction
```{r}

tournament_data

```

##***Data Extraction***


Using regex to extract data for each column of the dataframe.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}

#these regular expressions relies on the use of back references to find the strings present in the file that are delimited or preceded by bars | and/or spaces.

#Extracts players' ids
player_id <-unlist(str_extract_all(tournament_data,"[0-9]{1,}(?=\\s\\|)"))

#Extracts players' names
player_name <-unlist(str_extract_all(tournament_data,"((?<=([[0-9]{1,}]\\s\\|\\s))[a-zA-Z]{1,}(\\s[a-zA-Z]{1,})?\\s[a-zA-Z]{1,})"))

#Extracts players' average points 
player_points <-as.numeric( unlist(str_extract_all(tournament_data,"([0-9]\\.[0-9])")))

#Extracts players' state delimited by space and a bar
player_state  <- unlist(str_extract_all(tournament_data,"(\\b[A-Z]{1,}(?=\\s\\|))"))

#Extracts players' rating string which is preceded by R:
player_rating <- as.numeric(unlist(str_extract_all(tournament_data,"(?<=R:)\\s.?([0-9]{1,})")))

#dataframe that stores each player data
players_df <- data.frame(
  player_id,
  player_name,
  player_state,
  player_points,
  player_rating,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

```


Finding the opponent scores for a particular player in the dataframe and then computing the avergage 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}

#vector to store the ratings of the players faced by a particular player. This will be later used to compute the average oponent rating
avg_op_ratings <- vector()

for(pl_name in player_name) {
  pattern <- grep(pl_name,tournament_data,value = TRUE)
  #extract the id of the players indicated by the number of wins, loses or draws.
  record <- as.numeric(str_trim(unlist(str_extract_all(pattern,"(?<=(W|D|L))\\s{1,}([0-9]{1,})"))))
  #get the data from the dataframe where the row number is equals to the players' number and stores the pre rating values to compute the average
  avg_op_ratings <- c(avg_op_ratings, mean(as.integer(players_df[record,5])))

}

#add the new column to the dataframe 
players_df <- cbind(players_df,avg_op_ratings)



```




##***Generated Dataframe***

Display of data processed by R including new computed columns.

```{r}
scroll_box(
      kable_styling(
          kable(players_df), full_width = TRUE, bootstrap_options = c("striped","hover") ),
          width = "100%", height = "400px" 
      )

```
###***CSV File Creator***


```{r}
#creates csv file in your working directory or in the specific path as shown below
write.csv(players_df,"project1/chess_players_dt.csv")

```



###***Data visualization***



This graph shows all the chess players arranged according to their rating.

<div class="superbigimage">
```{r , fig.width=10, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}





ggplot(players_df, aes(x = reorder(player_name,player_rating), y = player_rating))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.8, fill="steelblue")+labs(title = "Chess Players Pre-Ratings")+xlab("Player Names")+ylab("Player Ratings")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 12),axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 9))+coord_flip()

```
</div>

###***Players grouped by points.***

This graph shows all the chess players arranged on groups according to their number of points. The players in dark purple color show the highest number of points.


<div class="superbigimage">
```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=10, echo= FALSE  }


ggplot(players_df, aes(x= reorder(player_name,-player_points), y= player_points,   fill= as.factor(player_points)))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 1,position = position_dodge())+labs(title = "Chess Players Number of Points")+xlab("Player Names")+ylab("Player Points")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 12),axis.text.y = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 9))+coord_flip()+scale_fill_discrete(name="Points")



```
</div>
